title: "Decluttering my iPhone"
description: "An empty iPhone feels like a new iPhone."

For the past few major OS X updates, I've done a clean install on my iMac/MacBook. When Apple officially released [iOS 8](https://www.apple.com/ios/) a few days ago, I decided to do the same with my iPhone 5S. It wasn't just setting it up as a new phone; I also used a new, empty [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) account. While I don't really have any particular reason for setting up my iPhone as a new phone, I have a good one for using a new iCloud account.

Previously, I had separate accounts for iTunes Store and iCloud. This is because when Apple announced iOS/OS X users are allowed @me email addresses, I decided to sign up for one. I've been using that @me email (now also an @icloud email) as my iCloud account, which is a separate account than my existing iTunes Store account. They're both considered Apple IDs, which I found quite confusing back then. Since Apple doesn't allow the merging of two Apple IDs, I've been using both for the past couple years. Now, I'm using my original Apple ID as both my iTunes Store account and my iCloud account, to make things easier. Interestingly, to be able to use some of the iCloud services, I still have to sign up for a new @icloud email address.

My using a new iCloud account means that I also "lost" my iCloud backups. So after the upgrade, my 5S really feels like a brand new phone; especially with the new default background image. The first things I download: [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/), [Whatsapp](http://www.whatsapp.com/), and [Line](http://line.me/en/). Basically the services I use for pretty much all of my communication needs. It's a little strange, but insanely exciting, how empty my iPhone is! It's so much fun setting up a new phone. I thought it would be a pain to have to reorganize my apps, but it's great that I only have apps I actually use. After about 48 hours, I've only used 8.4GB of storage, and 3GB of those are for music!

It is satisfyingly empty. I am planning do the same to my iPad, and to my MacBook when OS X Yosemite is finally released. Therefore, I really wouldn't have any backup of what I lose in this restore.

There were a few things that I did backup: messages, notes, reminders, and calendar. I had the help of [iBackupbot](http://www.icopybot.com/itunes-backup-manager.htm) to do so. It was quite simple to use, and definitely useful. Although, I don't think I ever figured out how to use it for backing up app data. I think I tried it with an app or two and it didn't work. But it doesn't matter. Empty iPhone really does feel like a new iPhone and I find it very satisfying.
