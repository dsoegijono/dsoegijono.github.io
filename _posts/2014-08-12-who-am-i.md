I think I became aware of the internet around the time I was in middle school or high school. It started with ICQ chats with random strangers and MSN messenger chats with my friends. And then came the online forums where I found people with similar interests. That's when I realized that I could have an "online persona." I could be anyone I wanted online, and I found that idea to be very attractive. Lately, it's [Twitter](https://twitter.com) and [Reddit](www.reddit.com), and I embraced anonymity; I tried as hard as possible to hide myself from my online profiles. Then I watched *The West Wing* (for the n-th time), and this Sam Seaborn quote stuck with me:

The negative side of online anonymity is the horrible comments scattered around the internet. I thought I was being more "me" with the ability of saying whatever I wanted, sans the brain filter I (almost) always use in the real world. Still, I shouldn't be saying things I don't want people to know I've said. I started feeling that the comfort of anonymity I found online was because I was hiding instead of simply finding privacy. This is why I recently started changing all my [online profiles](/about/#me-around-the-web) to using my name instead of a pseudoname. This website is a part of that. This blog will hopefully help define the "me" on the internet. As Sam Seaborn mandated, I'm signing my name. (Although, I'm still unable to turn off tweet privacy for [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/dsoegijono).)

Another reason why I started this website -- and this blog -- is because I wanted to have an online portfolio. I thought [GitHub](https://github.com/) would be the perfect tool, and I learned about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). It took me quite a while to set this website up, because what does one put on a personal website? I honestly still don't know. I want this to be the front page of "me." But as I'm still new at this (see above), I'm unsure of how I want my online identity established. At 24, I'm probably a bit old to still be worrying about this, huh? A lot of the personal websites I've looked at has a blog as its main content. I already have a [personal blog](http://dsoegijono.blogspot.com/), so maybe I'll use this as a more professional one. I doubt I'll be posting regularly but I am going to try.

If anyone knows who I am (or who I should be online), please let me know!
