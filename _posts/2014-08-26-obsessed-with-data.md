By data I mean the data of "me." Not exactly sure why, but lately I've been very interested in logging everything I do. What movies or TV shows I watch, what games I play, how much time I spend working vs. procrastinating, etc. I want to know how I use my time doing what. Not that I'd know what to do with this data should I have it, I just...need it.

#### Apps/tools I currently use

- [Momento](http://www.momentoapp.com/): A journal/diary iOS app that connects to social networking sites. I basically use this to collect all my social networking posts in one app; I very rarely post straight to the app itself.
- [TodoMovies](http://www.taphive.com/todomovies/): An iOS app that reminds you when new movies come out. I use it to keep track of movies I want to watch. This is actually an app that I've wanted to create, but my app would also have more info on the movies watched, such as date watched, total length, etc. (again with the collection of data). For now, I have a Google spreadsheet that keeps track of all movies I watch each year. As of this writing, in 2014 I have watched 51 movies with the total length of 98 hours and 13 minutes. I still have yet to figure out how to log my TV show watching activity, especially since I watch way more TV than movies.
- [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/dsoegijono/charts) Scrobbles: What music I listen to. They could add the song length so I can see how much time I spend listening to one artist compared to another.
- [SleepCycle](http://www.sleepcycle.com/) & [SleepBot](https://mysleepbot.com/): Not that I understand what "sleep quality" means, but I just want to know how much I sleep. I'd be interested in seeing how much my sleeping pattern would differ once I go back to a 9 to 5 office job.
- I also have a few fitness apps, which should log my walks/runs. But since I don't do either, they're pretty useless.

A lot of apps have their own activity logs, and it bothers me that some of them are broken. [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) is supposed to log how many hours I've played a game, but I'm pretty sure it's broken. My [Football Manager 14](http://www.footballmanager.com/lang/en_GB), for example; I finished playing at 314 hours, close Steam, and reopen sometime later, and it's back to ~250 hours. This happens quite a few times. I believe it's up to around ~265 hours now even though I've played way more than that. Also somewhat annoying: [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com)'s "Recent Activity" list isn't working for my profile. If someone knows how to fix this for me, please let me know! It works for other profiles on my account, just not the profile I'm using.

#### Apps/tools I ~~need~~ want

- As I've mentioned above, I could use a way to log my TV show watching activity. Maybe a [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) plugin that logs what I watch, since that's the player that I use almost all the time (should include date/time watched, length of video).
- Pretty much a complete activity logger. But if it's possible, automated instead of asking me to input what I'm doing. If I'm currently writing this blog post while listening to music on Spotify, I want both to be recorded. The thing about manual logging is that I tend to only log one thing at a time, when I usually do [multiple things at once](http://instagram.com/p/ruRlVJHIeC/?modal=true).

Is there anything I can use, or build, that can help me with my quest to log every single one of my activities?
